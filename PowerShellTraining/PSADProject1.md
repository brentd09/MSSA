# Create new users in Active Directory from a CSV file

  > Make sure all of these functions get saved in your GitHub Repository 

## Complete the following before starting this project

- Logon to LON-CL1 as the ADATUM\Administrator
  - From LON-CL1 
    - Launch PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe)
      - *If you wish to run this from ISE you will get prompted to install a new version of NuGet*
    - Run this command to install a new module from PowerShell Gallery to download files from GitHub 
    ```
    Install-Module GitHubToolsBD -Force
    ```
    - Run this command to download the CSV file needed for this project
    ```
    Get-FilesFromRepo -GitHubUserName brentaiict -Repository MSSA-SCA -PathInRepo PowerShellTraining -FilesToRetrieve NewHires.csv -Destination E:\ 
    ```

# Use following brief to complete this project via PowerShell

- Create a PowerShell function within **PowerShell ISE** or **VSCode**
  - Include Comment Based Help
  - only use Parameters for information input, the function must run without interruption 
  - use a parameter for the CSV file, 
    - make sure the parameter has a default value for the path to the "e:\NewHires.csv" file 
  - Save the function as a module in an autoloading directory ($env:PSModulePath will list the correct directories to choose from) 
  - Test the new PowerShell command you have created

## What must the PowerShell function achieve

- Use the NewHires.csv file to create the new employees Active Directory
- Check first to see if OUs and Groups exist for all of the users that will be created 
  - if not, have the PowerShell create OUs and Global Security Groups for any departments that are missing 
- Use Powershell to create each of these new users (from the NewHires.csv file)
  - Each user **must** 
    - Be created within the **OU relating to their department**
    - Be added to the **Security Group that relates to their department**
    - Have the unique **password (found in the NewHires.csv file) set for their user account**
    - Have all of the AD properties added as per the NewHires.csv file
    - Have the AD property called "SamAccountName" created comprising of the First letter of the FirstName and the LastName combined, all in lowercase
      - for example "FirstName = Ben, LastName =  Smith", 
      - you will need to use an AD property called, **"SamAccountName"** that have the value **"bsmith"**    
    - Have the AD Property called "Name" created which consists of "FirstName LastName"
      - for example "FirstName = Ben, LastName =  Smith", 
      - you will need to use an AD property called, **"Name"** that have the value **"Ben Smith"**[...](PSADProjectSolutions.md#solutions-for-the-ps-projects)   

## Test if your function worked by running:
   
```
# If your function worked this will show users within the contractors group
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity Contractors
```
