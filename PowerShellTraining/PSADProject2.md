# Use following brief to complete this project via PowerShell

- Create a PowerShell function within **PowerShell ISE** or **VSCode**
  - Include Comment Based Help
  - do not use parameters for this function 
  - use Out-Griview to list the deleted AD users and have the ability to selct one or more deleted user
  - Save the function in the module you created in Project 1

## What must the PowerShell function achieve

- Recover deleted user from Domain Controller Recycle-Bin
- Write a function that does the following:
  - Lists all deleted object using Out-Gridview
  - Allows someone to choose which deleted user/s are to be restored
  - Restore the chosen user/s
  - Show the restored AD object on screen to prove restoration was successful 
  - Add this function to the previous module from Project 1

## HINTS (You will need these commands to complete your task)[...](PSADProjectSolutions.md#solutions-for-the-ps-projects)
```
# This command finds deleted objects
Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter:"(msDS-LastKnownRDN=*)" -IncludeDeletedObjects | Where-Object {$_.Deleted -eq $true}

# This command restores a deleted object 
Restore-ADObject 

# This command can help produce a menu of choices
Out-Gridview
```

## Test the results by running your function:
   
 - Run your function and select one or more users from the GridView windows
 - Make sure the user/s have been restored

  $ADObjectsChosen = $DeletedObjects | Out-GridView -OutputMode Multiple  # Choose which objects to restore
  $ADObjectsChosen | Restore-ADObject -confirm:$false # This restores the chosen object
  # this finds the restored objects in AD  
  $RestoredObjects = Get-ADObject -Filter * | Where-Object {$_.ObjectGuid -in $ADObjectsChosen.ObjectGuid}  
  return $RestoredObjects   # Show the restored objects on the screen (this is the optional requirement)
}
