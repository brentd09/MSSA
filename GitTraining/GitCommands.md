- This workflow is very useful especially when you are working with a cloned repository
- **Fetch** looks at the remote repository to collect metadata (but no file download)
- **Status** can then tell us if there are any changes to be pulled to our local repo, before you make any changes
  - ***If we fail to do this our changes will be out of step with the remote branch and we will not be able to push our changes***
- **Pull** will only be used here if there has been changes made to the remote branch that we should sync to our local branch
- *Make any changes to the files in the Repo directory or sub directories*
- **Add** takes that changes and new files that have happened within the Repo directory and stages them ready for commiting
- **Commit** takes all of the changes in the staging area and creates a shapshot of the repository
- **Push** takes the commited changes and syncs them with the remote repository
