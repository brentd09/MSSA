  $ADObjectsChosen | Restore-ADObject -confirm:$false # This restores the chosen object

## Project 3 - Find all groups related to an AD user

### This solution provides the basic solution
    
```PowerShell
function Find-AssociatedGroupMembership {
  <#
  .SYNOPSIS
    This command will find all related groups given a users samaccountname
  .DESCRIPTION
    This command will find all of the groups a user is a member of and then
    will located all groups that those groups are a member of and repeat this 
    until no more memberships can be found. These groups will then be displayed
    as output
  .EXAMPLE
    Find-AssociatedGroupMembership
    This command will find all related groups given a users samaccountname
  .PARAMETER SamAccountName
    This is the SamAccountName that is associated with the use in question
